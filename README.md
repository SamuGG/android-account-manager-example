## Android Account Manager Example App
<br/>
Android app using the [Account Manager](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html) service to handle custom application user accounts.

Example shows how to create custom app accounts on your device, choose between them and authenticate them by calling getAuthToken.
There are 2 activities:

- LoginActivity
- MainActivity

The **MainActivity** requires to be authenticated, so it will open LoginActivity automatically if no auth token could be retrieved from any acount.

The **LoginActivity** is used for login and registration purposes equally. Once authenticated, the app stores in Preferences the account name and the generated auth token.

### How to login
In this demo, a static account repository was created with dummy accounts, which you may use for testing:

- user@example.com / password: pass
- demo@example.com / password: demo
- foo@example.com / password: foobar

### How to create an account
You can create app accounts either from the LoginActivity opened at the app start, or by navigating to your device general settings -> Accounts -> + Add account.

Multiple accounts can be created.
